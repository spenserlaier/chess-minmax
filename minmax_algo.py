'''
minimax bug summary:
    unlike in regular (non-ai) play, the ai seems to have issues properly recognizing valid moves and pieces,
    which is strange because the same move detection code is used in both gamemodes.
    For example, each piece automatically excludes its starting position from the list of moves,
    but the ai will try to execute "moves" to the starting position
    Similarly, each piece excludes moves that explicitly capture the king, but the ai will
    attempt to execute those moves. This implies that there's some kind of miscommunication
    between the application components
