how should the available moves for different pieces be computed and represented?

one idea is, each time a move is made, scan the board for the existence of check or checkmate
    a checked state occurs when one piece's set of available (i.e. valid) moves contains the coordinates
    of the opposing side's king

    if we detect a check state, we also need to compute all possible theoretical moves
    from the checked team to determine if any one of them can free the team from check
        if a theoretical free state exists, then the team is in check but not checkmate, the game can continue
        if no such state exists, then it's checkmate and the game is over
if neither exists, then compute all valid moves for each piece in the current board configuration
    if the user clicks on a piece, allow them to move that piece to the calculated valid coordinates
        and proceed to the next turn
    if they attempt to move to an invalid coordinate for that piece, reset the piece and do not continue
        to the next turn
